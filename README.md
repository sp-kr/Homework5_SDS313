# This project analyzes NWSL soccer player data from three CSV files (ChicagoStarsNEW.csv, GothamFCNEW.csv, HoustonDashNEW.csv). The files were made with data scraped from https://fbref.com/en/

# For the analysis, I made a histogram of player ages and a scatterplot of minutes played vs goals scored.

# To reproduce, download all of the csv and rmd files, open the rmd file in RStudio, make sure the  csv files are in the same folder, install the tidyverse package, and run the code.
